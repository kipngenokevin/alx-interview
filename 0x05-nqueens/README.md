# 0x05. N Queens
`Algorithm` `Python`

The “0x05. N queens” project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand several key concepts and have access to resources that will help you grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.

## Concepts Needed:
1. **Backtracking Algorithms:**

* Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.

2. **Recursion:**

* Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.
